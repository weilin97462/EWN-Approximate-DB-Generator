# EWN-Approximate-DB-Generator
This code generates an approximate database for "Einstein WÃ¼rfelt Nicht!".

You can get a executable named `DB_builder` after `make`. You can then execute `DB_builder` to generate the database.

Make sure you modified all the settings in `src/config.hpp` before you compile, these settings include:
* number of threads
* memory space this program can use
* size per instance
* default read/write permission for the database

If your os is not Linux, please uncomment `// #define USE_PORTABLE_FALLOCATE` in `src/config.hpp`.

This program is designed and optimized for linux, the compatability to other OS is not guaranteed.
